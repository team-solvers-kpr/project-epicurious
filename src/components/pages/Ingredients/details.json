Most serious wine drinkers have plenty of regular corkscrews, but sometimes traditional wine openers are too much for older, delicate corks which can crumble when stabbed and tugged—leading to tiny specs of cork in your glass. Enter the ah so-style wine opener. It slides around the wine cork rather than through it, allowing the cork to be gently wiggled out, and it spares the wine lover in your life from having to double strain a pricey bottle of actually-vintage vintage cabernet sauvignon.",
